	 <h2>What is Fight, Flight or Freeze?</h2>
	 <p>The fight, flight or freeze response is a physiological reaction that occurs when we are aware of being in the presence of something that is physically or mentally stressing. This response is activated by the release of hormones which prepare you to run away to safety,  to stay and deal with the threat or to stay completely still preparing for the next move.</p>

	<h2>How Our Mind Reacts:</h2>
	 <p>Along with the physiological response, you may experience psychological effects as well. Acute stress in the form of nervousness can increase the intensity of your anger, the speed of your flight or your mind may become blank, making it difficult to decide what to do next.</p>
	 <p>Several psychological responses can happen. You feel anxiety. Your focus shifts to broader concerns, diminishing your attention to smaller tasks. Both the physiological and psychological stress shift your body and mind into survival mode. These responses  give us a chance to overcome danger or escape it so we can stay alive.</p>
	 <p>These responses can also be triggered at times when they aren't needed. When that happens, these drastic changes can damage our physical and mental health.</p>
		
	<h3>Examples of What Can Cause Fight, Flight or Freeze</h3>
	 <li>Jumping out of a vehicle's way</li>
	 <li>Feeling unsafe walking down the street</li>
	 <li>Seeing a growling animal</li>
	 <li>A car in front suddenly stopping</li>
		
	<h4>Why is it important?</h4>
	 <p>Fight, flight or freeze is how we deal with stress and danger in our environment. It allows us to perform better and act effectively when under pressure. It can be triggered by both real and imaginary threats. If the threat is real, fight, flight or freeze can help to increase chances of survival. Where the perceived threat is imaginary, fight, flight or freeze can cause unnecessary stress.</p>
